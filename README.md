# Assignment 1 â€“ Divide and Conquer Algorithms

##  Learning Goals
- Implement classical **Divide-and-Conquer algorithms** with safe recursion patterns.
- Analyze recurrence relations using **Master Theorem** (3 cases) and **Akraâ€“Bazzi theorem**.
- Verify theoretical results through practical benchmarking.
- Collect metrics (**execution time, recursion depth, number of comparisons/allocated objects**) and present them in a report.

##  Algorithms 

### 1. MergeSort (Master Case 2)
- Uses **linear merge**.
- Implements **buffer for memory reuse**.
- Introduces **cut-off for small n** â†’ switches to insertion sort.
- Recurrence:  
  `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î˜(n)` â†’ `Î˜(n log n)` (Master Case 2).

### 2. QuickSort (Randomized)
- **Pivot chosen randomly**.
- Recursion always goes into the **smaller partition**, larger handled iteratively.
- Stack limited to **O(log n)** on average.
- Recurrence:  
  `T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + Î˜(n)` â†’ average `Î˜(n log n)`.

### 3. Deterministic Select (Median-of-Medians)
- Splits array into groups of 5.
- Recursively selects pivot as median of medians.
- Recursion only in the required subarray.
- Recurrence:  
  `T(n) â‰¤ T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + Î˜(n)` â†’ `Î˜(n)` (Akraâ€“Bazzi).

### 4. Closest Pair of Points (2D)
- Points sorted by **x-coordinate**.
- Recursively divides into two halves.
- In the strip, checks up to 7â€“8 neighbors in **y-order**.
- Recurrence:  
  `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î˜(n)` â†’ `Î˜(n log n)` (Master Case 2).

##  Metrics 
- Execution time (ms).
- Recursion depth.
- Number of comparisons and allocations.
- Results stored in CSV for visualization.

### Planned Charts
- **Time vs n**: asymptotic comparison.
- **Depth vs n**: confirm logarithmic recursion depth.
- Discussion of constant factors: cache, JIT, GC.

---

##  Architecture
- All algorithms inside `org.example` package.
- Metrics support via `Metrics` class.
- Results output in `results/` (CSV + plots).
- Benchmarking via **JMH** (`BenchmarkRunner`).

---

##  GitHub Workflow 
- **main** â†’ only stable releases (`v0.1`, `v1.0`).
- **feature branches**:
    - `feature/mergesort`
    - `feature/quicksort`
    - `feature/select`
    - `feature/closest`
    - `feature/metrics`
    - `feature/bench`

### Commit storyline:
- `init`: maven, junit5, ci, readme
- `feat(metrics)`: counters, depth tracker, CSV writer
- `feat(mergesort)`: baseline + buffer + cutoff + tests
- `feat(quicksort)`: randomized pivot + smaller-first recursion
- `refactor(util)`: partition, swap, shuffle, guards
- `feat(select)`: deterministic select (MoM5) + tests
- `feat(closest)`: divide-and-conquer implementation + tests
- `feat(cli)`: args, run algos, emit CSV
- `bench(jmh)`: select vs sort
- `docs(report)`: master cases & AB intuition, plots
- `fix`: edge cases (duplicates, tiny arrays)
- `release`: v1.0

---

## âœ… Testing 
- **MergeSort / QuickSort**: tested on random and worst-case arrays; recursion depth â‰¤ `~2*log2(n)`.
- **Select**: compared with `Arrays.sort()[k]` on 100 random tests.
- **Closest Pair**: validated against O(nÂ²) implementation for `n â‰¤ 2000`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
- Theory confirmed by experiments:
    - MergeSort & Closest Pair â†’ `Î˜(n log n)`
    - QuickSort â†’ `Î˜(n log n)` average with random pivot
    - Deterministic Select â†’ linear `Î˜(n)`
- Minor deviations caused by cache, allocations, and JVM optimizations.
